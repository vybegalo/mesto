# Project Yandex Praktikum "Место"

## Description

This is a repository which contains my fourth practical project work at [Yandex Praktikum "Frontend Developer"](https://practicum.yandex.ru/web/) course.
## Technologies used

In order to make the layout "rubber" I used `@media` queries and put down a set of break points for different screen widths: 1280px, 1024px, 768px, 320px. The site has a popup which opens and closes on click (and the escape key). The form fields are filled with the values that are on the page. I used JS that edit form fields and change values on a website page. My like buttons are clickable and change its color. With the help of JS it changes color when it is active or not.
